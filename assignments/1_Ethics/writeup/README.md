### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the ELMS assignment.

### Part 2 (75 pts)

I would inform my boss and upper level management about the security issue that I have found.  I believe these individuals should be able to provide me the assistance necessary to assemble a team to tackle this issue.  I would not, by any means, reveal the security issue to the public or consumer watchdogs.  Revealing this security issue externally provides a great risk, particularly if the exploitation is an attack that a hypothetical attacker might otherwise not consider.  If management is not supportive of this issue or refuses to delay the ECU’s release, I would spread the news internally.  This would allow me to gain support within the firm, and with people on my side, management may elect to change their mind.  If I choose not bringing up this issue, I can be partially blamed for any harm that results.  As a security engineer, my job is to locate major security bugs and solve them.  By not reporting this vulnerability to management, I am not fully doing my job.  However, I do not believe I am personally liable.  The security issue could have been detected by the programmer or higher-level executives.  There is no single person to blame if any harm results, so the company should be liable.
Some individuals might encourage the firm to release the issue to the public, as it would encourage individuals to drive less frequently.  This could reduce the change that there is an attack.  Some also might argue that by being open to the public it would be beneficial in the long run as it indicates that the firm cares about its users’ security.  However, this approach would make an attack more likely, since the vulnerability would be revealed.
Some individuals might argue that spreading the news internally is a bad idea as my colleagues may not have the same ethical standards as I do.  They might tell the public behind my back.  However, I believe this would be the best way to convince upper management to take me seriously.
Some individuals might argue that I should be liable because I could use my knowledge of the security issue to attack the firm or have someone else attack the firm on my behalf.  I would say I am personally liable if this is indeed the case.  However, if not, I believe I am not the only person at fault.
