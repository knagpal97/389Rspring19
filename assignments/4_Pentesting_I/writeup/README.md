Calling nc 1337bank.money 1337 allows me to run a program on port 1337.  This program prompts the user to enter an ip address and calls linux's dig on the ip address that the user inputs.  However, this command is susceptible to command injection.  By entering any ip address followed by a semicolon and ls, I was able to realize that I have access to a system shell and can access all of the folders that exist in the system shell.  I reran the nc command using command injection to check the contents in each folder present in the system shell.  When I typed ;cd home;ls, I found the file flag.txt.  I typed ;cat home/flag.txt, and it was revealed that the flag is CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}.
v0idcache could prevent this attack in 2 ways.  One way is to ensure that there are no open ports on the website's server.  The The second way is to validate user inputs to prevent command injection.  One method of doing this is by validating user input to ensure that the user can only input characters in a specific character set or that the user input matches a specific regular expression.  Another method involves preceding special characters such as ( ) < > & * ‘ | = ? ; [ ] ^ ~ ! . ” % @ / \ : + , and ` with a ^ or a \ depending on what operating system is used to escape the character.

I modified stub.py and added 4 commands.  The command shell allows for the user to access the system shell and enter as many commands as they would like without having to recall nc 1337bank.money 1337 over and over again.  The user can cd from the root branch to /home by calling shell and cd home.  He can then see the contents of this folder by calling ls.  Ls reveals that flag.txt is present in the home folder and the user can call cat flag.txt to reveal its contents.  The command pull allows for the user to access a document from the system shell and save it to their local folder.  By typing pull /home/flag.txt flag.txt, the user can effortlessly download the flag.txt file from the system shell and save the file in the same directory which the program is present.  The command help displays a help menu and the command exit exits the program.
